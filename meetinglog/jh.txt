- GOTPM 실행
Job 실행 완료 후 Output files를 사용하여

3.5 Homework 
1. Plot the parallel performance of the GOTPM-mV as a function of the number of cpu cores (total cpu cores = the number of mpi ranks times the number of threads). 

2. Make a movie file from the files of xzslice.*. Be careful of the scale of density for a better view. Sometimes log-scale density would be enough, or some dummy idea leads to a better view.
